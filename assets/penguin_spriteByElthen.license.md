1. Hey why did it take you so long to post licensing information?

I was in contact with the creative commons for some information and clarification. I wanted to do this right and have taken my time to do the reading and considering all the angles.

2. So what has changed? 

Pretty much nothing. It's the same as I've stated many times before: As long as you don't resell, redistribute the assets, you are good to use them in both commercial and noncommercial projects.

3. But it says Noncommercial on the title! How come we can use the assets in commercial titles?!

That's why there are supplemental permissions given. You can read more about it here. 

4. Is there anywhere else I can read about this creative commons things?

Yep, you can [visit their site](https://creativecommons.org/)

5. I still have questions, can I contact you?

Please do! You can [e-mail me](mailto:ahmetsamiavci@gmail.com)
